## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of Java implementations of data structures and algorithms. The primary aim of this project is a deeper understanding of fundamental DSA concepts and their usage in real-world scenarios. By exploring this repository, you can gain insights into how these principles can be leveraged to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the modules in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Anil-Gehlot/Java-DSA
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

    ```bash
         cd Java-DSA
3. Browse through the different modules to explore the implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Modules

The repository is organized into different modules, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm. Here's a brief overview of each module:

- `arrays : `    Implementations of dynamic arrays, matrices, and related algorithms.
- `linked-lists : ` Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists along with associated operations.
- `stacks : `    Implementation of stack data structure and relevant algorithms.
- `queues : `    Implementation of queue data structure and relevant algorithms.
- `trees: : `     Implementations of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- `sorting : `   Various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, and more.
- `searching : ` Implementation of searching algorithms including linear search, binary search, and more.

Feel free to explore these modules and delve into the code to understand how different data structures and algorithms are implemented.

## Contributing
